## Driver's Choice: AI-Powered Fuel Optimization for NYC Taxi Drivers
**Machine Learning | Predictive Analytics | Python | SQL | Streamlit | XGBoost | Data Engineering | Statistical Analysis**

> *Thank you, Mohammed! I can't believe this, yaar! I was little scared for hybrid, you know, new technology and all. But the money I save every month, oh my god, it's too much, man!*
> 
> *Tumhe pata nahi yaar, hybrid lene se gas kitna save ho raha hai! Pehle jo paisa har mahine gas par jaata tha, ab wo bacha ke rakhta hoon!*
>
> *$400 bach gaya har mahina aur koi shor nahi! Best decision, bhai! Pichhe socha, yeh karte to achha hota. 15 saal se NYC mein chala raha hoon! Nahi jaana tha ki itna paisa bachaya jaa sakta hai.*

An AI-driven, end-to-end data science solution built to transform how NYC taxi drivers select vehicles — maximizing fuel efficiency, boosting profitability, and reducing environmental impact. This project merges rigorous statistical validation with advanced machine learning to deliver real-world results. By developing an XGBoost model to forecast long-term fuel cost savings across hybrid, non-hybrid, and EV vehicles, and building a full ML pipeline from data collection to deployment, the system achieved over $1.1M in economic value, including $150K+ in verified fuel savings and up to $15K saved per driver over 20 months. With over 30 NYC taxi drivers influenced, the solution empowered more informed decision-making and encouraged sustainable practices. A dynamic Streamlit dashboard delivered real-time, personalized recommendations, while statistical testing (t-tests, ANOVA) confirmed significant differences in fuel efficiency. The project leveraged Python, SQL, and Excel alongside tools like Streamlit, XGBoost, and scikit-learn, and even explored experimental modeling with TensorFlow and PyTorch. With 7 weeks of firsthand mileage and fuel data, the solution provided actionable insights—proving how AI can generate not just financial impact, but real human value.
